Problem Statement:-

Toll booths often cause significant time wastage due to congestion and inefficient collection methods. Despite the introduction of systems like FASTag, technical failures frequently lead to manual intervention and further delays. A major shortcoming is the absence of a pre-booking mechanism, which results in all vehicles being treated equally, regardless of urgency or planning. Moreover, current toll systems lack effective real-time vehicle verification, making it difficult to identify registered users accurately. Users who mistakenly enter the wrong lane after booking an express pass receive no refunds, which adds to user frustration. Additionally, there is no time-sensitive validation system to ensure that toll bookings are used within a specific window, reducing system effectiveness. Lastly, toll management systems underutilize modern technologies such as AI-powered cameras, missing out on opportunities to enhance traffic flow and enforce rules efficiently.

Objective:-

-to Reduce waiting time at toll booths by introducing an express lane system for pre-booked users. -to Develop a mobile application that allows users to book toll passage within a 5â€“10 km range of the toll plaza. -to Implement RFID and AI camera-based monitoring to verify bookings and detect unauthorized lane usage. -to Enforce strict penalties for vehicles entering the express lane without prior booking to ensure compliance. -to Introduce a fair refund system for users who booked the express lane but ended up in the regular FASTag liane. -to Ensure time-bound entry through the express lane by defining a limited valid duration after booking. -to Enhance toll management efficiency using smart, automated, and scalable digital solutions.
