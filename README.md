Problem Statement:-

Toll plazas on highways like NH66 often face heavy congestion, leading to time delays even with FASTag systems in place. To solve this, we propose a Smart Toll Express Booking System that allows users to pre-book access to a dedicated Express Lane within 5–10 km of the toll booth.The express lane will be monitored by AI cameras to detect unregistered vehicles, with fines for violations. Users who book but use the regular lane will receive a partial refund. This system aims to reduce waiting time, ensure faster traffic flow, and improve toll booth efficiency.

Objective:-

-to Reduce waiting time at toll booths by introducing an express lane system for pre-booked users. -to Develop a mobile application that allows users to book toll passage within a 5–10 km range of the toll plaza. -to Implement RFID and AI camera-based monitoring to verify bookings and detect unauthorized lane usage. -to Enforce strict penalties for vehicles entering the express lane without prior booking to ensure compliance. -to Introduce a fair refund system for users who booked the express lane but ended up in the regular FASTag liane. -to Ensure time-bound entry through the express lane by defining a limited valid duration after booking. -to Enhance toll management efficiency using smart, automated, and scalable digital solutions.
